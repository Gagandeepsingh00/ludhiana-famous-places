            <p>This place is a good picnic and day-out spot. The park has a lot to offer especially for children i.e. toy trains, rides, games and activities. The park also has a beautifully carved out bicycle lane, walking track, eateries with proper security. It is suggested to avoid visiting the park on weekends due to overcrowding.
